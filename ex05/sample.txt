The written texts selected into this chapter represent careful written English,which, in most cases, will have been edited by more than one person. This kindof English is meant to reflect the educated KenE that the present book set out todescribe. With the exception of 8.11 and 8.15, each text, however short it is, con-tains at least two features (be they lexical, morphological, syntactic, or dis-course-related) discussed earlier in the book. The features in question arepointed out, as language points of interest, below each text. In each case,cross-reference is made to the specific section where they were discussed. Thetexts have been reproduced verbatim, except for the highlighting, in bold face,of the features under analysis. (The wordsichas been added after some poten-tially misleading typographical mistakes in the original.)
